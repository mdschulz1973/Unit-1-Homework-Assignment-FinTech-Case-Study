# RELEASE THE KRAKEN

## Beginnings

  ### Kraken Exchange and Kraken Financial

* The focus of this study is Kraken Financial, but because it is an offshoot of one of the original Crypto-Exchanges, I will also provide some information on Kraken Exchange.  Kraken Exchange was founded in 2011 to serve as a replacement for [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox), an exchange on which Bitcoin (BTC/XBT) and other digital currencies were traded for each other and for fiat currencies.  After a high profile hacking incident in which Mt. Gox was relieved of $460,000 worth of BTC, Kraken was concieved as a robust, large scale exchange with proof of reserves and solid planning for security.  Kraken launched in 2013, offering Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Euro trades to users in Europe and the U.S.  Operations began in Japan in 2014 and other digital and fiat currencies have been added since.

* According to the Wall Street Journal, the exchange received "a $5 million Series A investment, according to its parent San Francisco-based Payward Inc. Hummingbird Ventures, a Belgium-based venture firm, led the deal. Other backers are Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, which also backed Circle, and is run by Barry Silbert, as well as Trace Mayer, and other angels."
  
* Kraken was founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell, who remains CEO of the Exchange, based in San Francisco.  

## Origin of Kraken Financial 

* In 2019, the legislature of Wyoming passed a bill allowing for Special Purpose Depository Institutions ([SPDI](http://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/home/areas-of-regulation/laws-and-regulation/special-purpose-depository-institution)), which allows banking status to institutions such as Kraken Financial access to the regulatory state in the same way as traditional banks.  On September 16, 2020, the Wyoming Banking Board voted unanimously to grant Kraken Financial it's charter as an SPDI.  David Kinitsky was hired as CEO of Kraken Financial to head operations in Wyoming beginning this year.
