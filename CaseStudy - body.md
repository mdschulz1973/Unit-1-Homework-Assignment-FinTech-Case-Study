# RELEASE THE KRAKEN

## Beginnings

  ### Kraken Exchange and Kraken Financial

* The focus of this study is Kraken Financial, but because it is an offshoot of one of the original Crypto-Exchanges, I will also provide some information on Kraken Exchange.  Kraken Exchange was founded in 2011 to serve as a replacement for [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox), an exchange on which Bitcoin (BTC/XBT) and other digital currencies were traded for each other and for fiat currencies.  After a high profile hacking incident in which Mt. Gox was relieved of $460,000 worth of BTC, Kraken was concieved as a robust, large scale exchange with proof of reserves and solid planning for security.  Kraken launched in 2013, offering Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Euro trades to users in Europe and the U.S.  Operations began in Japan in 2014 and other digital and fiat currencies have been added since.

* According to the Wall Street Journal, the exchange received "a $5 million Series A investment, according to its parent San Francisco-based Payward Inc. Hummingbird Ventures, a Belgium-based venture firm, led the deal. Other backers are Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, which also backed Circle, and is run by Barry Silbert, as well as Trace Mayer, and other angels."
  
* Kraken was founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell, who remains CEO of the Exchange, based in San Francisco.  

### Origin of Kraken Financial 

* In 2019, the legislature of Wyoming passed a bill allowing for Special Purpose Depository Institutions ([SPDI](http://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/home/areas-of-regulation/laws-and-regulation/special-purpose-depository-institution)), which allows banking status to institutions such as Kraken Financial access to the regulatory state in the same way as traditional banks.  On September 16, 2020, the Wyoming Banking Board voted unanimously to grant Kraken Financial it's charter as an SPDI.  David Kinitsky was hired as CEO of Kraken Financial to head operations in Wyoming beginning this year.
  

## Kraken Financial Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  Better regulatory position. Good control location for custody.  Infrastructure, direct access to the federal payments system and integrate that into customer products and experiences.  Offer different products, and serve a different category of customers, such as institutions.

* 2019, when Wyoming passed a law allowing cryptocurrency exchanges to operate as banks, which can both receive deposits and custody assets.  Previously, exchanges were allowed to operate under a different set of rules as Money Services Businesses (MSB).  This set of rules limits the financial institution to exchanging currency only, and proscribes them from taking deposits, providing interest bearing accounts, and engaging customers with other services that involve the holding of customer money.  However, SPDI are NOT allowed to make loans of any kind.  No fractional reserve banking nor associated lending activities.  Currently, SPDI are limited by law to serving business customers with $5000 on deposit at the institution.

* Kraken Financial's focus is on U.S. business and institutional customers.  The market size is currently limited to those with knowledge of cryptocurrencies, but as public awareness increases and the availablity of bank-like crypto services increases, the market size will increase.  That said, it's hard to put a number on this because of it's potential to be so large.  Kraken has been in the crypto exchange market for nine years, which seems like a short duration, but they were one of the first large exchanges to list BTC and fiat currency.  They have also survived the innumerable security challenges that many others have succumbed to.  Therefore, Kraken brings years of expertise in security, exchange activities, and regulatory challenges that newcomers will not have.  Also, they do not have the baggage carried by the TBTF banks that may also enter this space, giving Kraken an optical advantage.  Among the other crypto exchanges, they are the first and so far only with a charter allowing them bank-like status so any early adopters have a only a single choice.



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? The exchange itself uses blockchain, encryption, multisig transactions, hot and cold storage wallets and two factor authentication.  A software development and security team writes and develop all of their own software.  They are not forthcoming regarding the specific technology they use because of the security risk they would be taking if it was disclosed.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  Kraken Financial is the first toe in the waters of traditional banking made by the crypto exchanges.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?  Crypto exchanges have begun offering derivatives and options on currencies, but these have been unregulated, therefore technically illegal in the U.S.  

* What are the other major companies in this domain?  Avanti Financial Group, headed by Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long.  It is likely others are applying for SPDI status in Wyoming but there is no official list of applicants online.  It's safe to assume that the TBTF banks are watching this sector carefully and will get in if they believe there is money to be made here.  Because SPDI are not able to lend money in any way, the TBTF banks are not seeing much benefit.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?  The only impact so far has been to spur regulators in Colorado to begin drafting their own charter for similar businesses.  Kraken is not open for business yet, but is in the process of completing pre-opening activities.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?  Kraken Exchange is rated in the top 10 exchanges by trading volume and has a reputation as one of the heavywieghts in the space.  Kraken Financial has a SPDI charter so they are literally without peers.
